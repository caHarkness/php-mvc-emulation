<h3>About</h3>
<p>This project exists as a template for PHP programmers to adapt Microsoft's MVC design philosophy in their own work. While not necessarily split into models, views, and controllers, php-mvc-emulation handles the entire GET uri and compiles a page based on the request. The php-mvc-emulation logic looks for either files and folders located in the <pre>pages</pre> folder, and passes additional parameters- delimited by <pre>/</pre>- in the address bar.</p>
