<h3>About</h3>
<p>This project exists as a template for PHP programmers to implement something similar to Microsoft's MVC design philosophy in their own work. While not necessarily split into models, views, and controllers, php-mvc-emulation handles the entire GET uri and compiles a page based on the request. The `php-mvc-emulation` logic looks for either files and folders located in the <i>pages</i> folder, and passes additional parameters&mdash;delimited by forward slashes&mdash;in the address bar.</p>
